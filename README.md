Starter Node.js project that includes Typescript tooling I end up installing for most of my Node.js repos.

## Installation

1. `git clone https://github.com/xetera/typescript-starter`
2. `cd node-starter`
3. `npm install`

## Included tooling

- Prettier
- Eslint
- Jest
- Fast Check
- Node TS
- Docker
- Circle CI

## Dependencies

- Dotenv
- Winston

### Why no yarn

I don't think Yarn is relevant in 2019 anymore. I personally believe that the JS community is divided enough in its tooling already and we don't need even more fragmentation. Stick with npm.

### Why no semicolons

Idk I think no semi looks nicer.

### Why no gulp/grunt

It's 2019
